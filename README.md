Hello and welcome! I'm Pavan ðŸ‘‹

I am currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree in Business Analytics & Artificial Intelligence at The University of Texas at Dallas. My interests and experience lie in Data Engineering, Data Analysis, and Business Intelligence. I am actively seeking internship and full-time opportunities across the United States in these domains.

With hands-on experience in building scalable data pipelines, designing cloud-based data warehouses, and developing advanced dashboards using tools like Python, SQL, Power BI, AWS, and Snowflake, I enjoy turning raw data into actionable insights. My academic foundation is complemented by real-world projects involving A/B testing, predictive modeling, and process automation.

I am eager to contribute my skills to a forward-thinking team and make a tangible impact through data-driven solutions.
